## Computer Vision Model for Horse Detection in a Custom Dataset


## Project Summary

The Final Team Project for this course assesses the application of computer vision introduced in the previous modules. You have been assigned to a group/team by your instructor. You and your teammate(s) have worked closely to brainstorm a problem, find a dataset, clean and pre-process it, and perform a computer vision project on the data using Python. For this project, you use Python in Google Colab, write a technical report, and prepare a recorded video presentation, including visuals based on your report.

## Project Deliverables and Submission Format:
